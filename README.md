# Unix-Command

- `source` will execute commands from a file in the current shell.

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- `. `(dot + space) is equivalent to `source`.

  ```bash
  . ./some.sh
  ```

- `cat` collect entire file's content and dump onto screen.
- `more` collect entire file's content display it in pages(space key for next page, enter key for next line)
- `less` collect enite file's content display it in pages, what it differs from `more` is that it's able to go back to   previous page
  ```bash
  cat ./text.txt
  more ./text.txt
  less ./text.txt
  ```

- `time` shows how long a command takes to run.
  ```bash
  # This will return total time it takes to finish wget command
  time wget https://some.com/download.txt
  ```

- `chmod` is used to change file permissions
  ```bash
  # user group others 
  # rwx  rwx   rwx
  
  # default permissions when create a file is rw-------
  # default permissions when create a directory is rwx------
  
  chmod u+x file.cpp # To give yourself permission to execute a file that you own
  chmod g+r file.cpp # To give members of your group permission to read a file
  chmod o+r file.cpp # To give other permission to read a file
  chmod a+r file.cpp # To all permission to read a file 
  chmod ugo+r file.cpp # To all permission to read a file
  chmod g=u+r file.cpp # assign user's permission to group
  'a' is equivalent to 'ugo'
  chmod a+r -R directory/* # To all permission to all files inside directory
  
  ##################### OR ####################
  # Numerica values for permissions are:
  # 4 = 100 = r-- = read
  # 2 = 010 = -w- = write
  # 1 = 001 = --x = execute
  # 3 = 011 = -wr = write + execute
  
  # change permission for use group and other
  chmod 333 file.cpp # 333 = 011 011 011 = -wx-wx-wx
  # is equivolent to
  chmod ugo+rx file.cpp
  ```
- `chown` is used to change file owner and group
  ```bash
  # Set the user 'daniel' from the group of 'admins' as owners of the directory
  # Note: -R is there when it's a directory
  chown -R daniel:admins important_directory
  ```


- `find` is used to find files in the operating system
  ```bash
  # Format: find <path> -name <filename> -print, <filename> can be wild card but with quotes, eg. '*.cp'
  find / \! -name "*.c" -print # Print out a list of all the files whose names do not end in .c
  find / -newer ttt -user wnj -print # Print out a list of all the files owned by user ``wnj'' that are newer than the file ttt
  find / \! \( -newer ttt -user wnj \) -print # Print out a list of all the files which are not both newer than ttt and owned by ``wnj''
  find / \( -newer ttt -or -user wnj \) -print # Print out a list of all the files that are either owned by ``wnj'' or that are newer than ttt
  find / -type f -exec echo {} \; # Use the echo(1) command to print out a list of all the files
  ```
  
- `cat` is to concatenate and print files
  ```bash
  # create a file named file.c and waiting for you to input content
  # Enter Ctrl-d to stop inputing and save the file
  cat > file.c
  ```
  
- `rm` is to remove files
  ```bash
  rm file.c
  # -i (interactive) option which makes the command prompt you for confirmation that you want to remove each file. Answer: y or n
  rm -i file.c
  ```

- `file` is to examines the content of a file and reports what type of file it is
  ```bash
  file file.sh
  # file.sh: Bourne-Again shell script text executable
  ```

- `head` is to display first 10 lines of the file
- `tail` is to display last 10 lines of the file
  ```bash
  head file.c
  tail file.c
  
  # -n can be used to define numbers of lines you want
  head -n 20 file.c # will give first 20 lines of the file
  
  # Trick to get lines in the middle of the file
  head -n 5 | tail -n 2 # this will give you line 4 and 5
  ```
  
- `ls` is to list the files in a directory
  ```bash
  # -l stands for long listing, to get more information about each file and directory
  # -a stands for all, lists hidden files, "hidden" files that begin with a '.' (dot). All other files and directories are also listed
  # -t sort by modification time, newest first
  # -h make file size human readable, size will end with unit suffixes like Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte 
  # -s list file size
  # -G list with colors
  ls -la # will list all files including hidden ones in long listing format
  ```

- `uname` is to report basic information about a computer's software and hardware
  ```bash
  # -s for kernel name (i.e., the default action)
  # -n for network node host name
  # -r for kernel version number and release level
  # -v for date of release of the kernel version
  # -m for machine hardware name
  # -p for CPU type (not available on some systems)
  # -i for general hardware platform
  # -o for operating system
  
  uname -sr # Linux 3.13.0-88-generic
  ```

- `mkdir` is to create directories

  ```bash
  # -m, --mode=MODE, set file mode (as in chmod), not a=rwx - umask
  mkdir -m 777 myFolder
  
  # -p, --parents, no error if existing, make parent directories as needed
  mkdir -p parentFolder/childFolder # error will be generated if no -p added
  
  # -v, --verbose, print a message for each created directory

  # -Z, --context=CTX, set the SELinux security context of each  created  directory  to CTX

  # --help display this help and exit

  # --version, output version information and exit
  ```

- `alias` is to create shortcuts or abbreviations

  ```bash
  alias ll="ls -al"
  alias ls="ls -G"
  ```

- `pushd`, `popd` and `dirs`. The `pushd` command saves the current working directory in memory so it can be returned to at any time, optionally changing to a new directory. The `popd` command returns to the path at the top of the directory stack. This directory stack is accessed by the command `dirs` in Unix

  ```bash
  # your current folder is ~/
  # you do
  pushd ~/.ssh/
  # it take you to ~/.shh, but saves ~/ in the stack
  
  # now you do
  dirs
  # output is ~/
  
  # now you do
  popd

  # it takes you to ~/
  ```

- `ps` - report a snapshot of the current processes.

  Note that "ps -aux" is distinct from "ps aux". The POSIX and UNIX standards require that "ps -aux" print all processes owned by a user named "x", as well as printing all processes that would be selected by the -a option. If the user

  ```bash
  ps aux | grep 'something'
  # it's identical to
  ps -e | grep 'something'
  
  # a show processes for all users
  # u display the process's user/owner
  # x also show processes not attached to a terminal
  # -A Display information about other users' processes, including those without controlling terminals.
  # -e Identical to -A
  # -f Display the uid, pid, parent pid, recent CPU usage, process start time, controlling tty, elapsed CPU usage, and the associated command.  If the -u option is also used, display the user name rather then the numeric uid.  When -o or -O is used to add to the      display following -f, the command field is not truncated as severely as it is in other formats.
  ```
  
  named "x" does not exist, this ps may interpret the command as "ps aux"
  
- `su` (short for substitute user) command makes it possible to change a login session's owner (i.e., the user who originally created that session by logging on to the system) without the owner having to first log out of that session.

  Although su can be used to change the ownership of a session to any user, it is most commonly employed to change the ownership from an ordinary user to the root (i.e., administrative) user, thereby providing access to all parts of and all commands on the computer or system. For this reason, it is often referred to (although somewhat inaccurately) as the superuser command. It is also sometimes called the switch user command.

  ```bash
  #A simplified expression of the syntax of the su command is:
  
  su [options] [commands] [-] [username]

  #The square brackets indicate that the enclosed item is optional. Thus, the simplest way to use the su command is to just type:

  su

  #The operating system assumes that, in the absence of a username, the user wants to change to a root session, and thus the user is prompted for the root password as soon as the ENTER key is pressed. This produces the same result as typing:

  su root

  #If the correct password is provided, ownership of the session is changed to root.

  #Likewise, to transfer the ownership of a session to any other user, the name of that user is typed after su and a space. For example, to change the owner of the current login session to a user named alice, type the following:

  su alice

  #The user will then be prompted for the password of the account with the username alice.
  ```
  
  [good resource](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/7013/why-do-we-use-su-and-not-just-su)
  
  `su` - invokes a login shell after switching the user. A login shell resets most environment variables, providing a clean base.

  `su` just switches the user, providing a normal shell with an environment nearly the same as with the old user.

- `du` (abbreviated from disk usage) is a standard Unix program used to estimate file space usageâ€”space used under a particular directory or files on a file system.

- `df` (abbreviation for disk free) is a standard Unix command used to display the amount of available disk space for file systems on which the invoking user has appropriate read access. df is typically implemented using the statfs or statvfs system calls.

- double dash `--`

  More precisely, a double dash (--) is used in bash built-in commands and many other commands to signify the end of command options, after which only positional parameters are accepted.

  Example use: lets say you want to grep a file for the string -v - normally -v will be considered the option to reverse the matching meaning (only show lines that do not match), but with -- you can grep for string -v like this:

  ```bash
  grep -- -v file
  ```

- `ssh` OpenSSH SSH client (remote login program)

  You can setup configuration in `~/.ssh/config` for ssh

  ```bash
   Host qa1
      User dong
      Hostname <ip_adress>

  # Now you can do 'ssh qa1', it will do 'ssh dong@<ip_adress>'
  ```

  Create ssh tunnel for forwarding

  ```bash
  ssh -N -R 3999:localhost:80 <example_ip>
  ```

  ```bash
  ssh -N -R
  ```

  The `-N` makes sure that you donâ€™t login to the remote server, and `-R` is what tells SSH to create the tunnel.


  ```bash
  3999:localhost:80
  ```

  This is where you set the port for the remote server, the local server address, and the port for the local server.

  The first number is the port that you want the remote server to listen on. This can be any number between 1024-65535, and youâ€™ll need to make sure to allow that port in your firewall if you have one set up. Next is the local server address. In almost all cases this will be localhost. And finally, the last number is the port that your local web server is listening on.

  ```bash
  <example_ip>
  ```

  The last part of the command is where you specify your user that has SSH access to the server and the address of the remote server.

  If you already have a domain name setup in DNS for the server, youâ€™ll be able to use that to access the tunnel. Otherwise, youâ€™ll need to use the serverâ€™s IP address.

  Now that you have an SSH tunnel open, going to the remote server address with the forwarded port in your browser, e.g. example.com:3999, should allow you to view your local website or app from anywhere with an internet connection.

  If you have `~/.ssh/config` set up with `LocalForward` like below

  ```bash
   Host qa1
      User dong
      Hostname <ip_adress>
      LocalForward 5000 <ip_adress>:<port_number>

  ```

  you can do

  ```bash
  ssh -N qa1
  ```

  or run it in background

  ```bash
  ssh -N -f qa1
  ```

  Both `ssh -N -f qa1` and `ssh -N qa1 &` will run the job in background, but the difference between two is that `ssh -N qa1 &` will attach to terminal, if terminal is closed, tunnel is closed too. `ssh -N -f qa1` will not attach the tunnel to the terminal.

- `lsb_release` print distribution specific information

  ```bash
  $ lsb_release -a
  LSB Version:	:base-4.0-amd64:base-4.0-noarch:core-4.0-amd64:core-4.0-noarch:graphics-4.0-amd64:graphics-4.0-noarch:printing-4.0-amd64:printing-4.0-noarch
  Distributor ID:	CentOS
  Description:	CentOS release 6.5 (Final)
  Release:	6.5
  Codename:	Final
  displays all of the above information.
  ```
  
- `top`

   ```bash
   top # a process monitor
   
   top -o cpu # sort the process by cpu usage
   ```
  
- `awk`- pattern scanning and processing language
  
  **Usage**
  ```bash
  awk '/search_pattern/ { action_to_take_on_matches; another_action; }' file_to_parse
  ```
  You can omit either the search_pattern or the action portion from any awk command. By default, the action taken if the "action" portion is not given is "print". This simply prints all lines that match.
  
  ```bash
  awk '/c/' /etc/fstab # print out the lines with "c" in it
  ```
  
  It's same as:
  
  ```bash
  awk '/c/ {print}' /etc/fstab # print out the lines with "c" in it
  ```
  
  we can use the action section to specify which pieces of information we want to print. For instance, to print only the first column, we can type:
  
  ```bash
  awk '{print $1}' /etc/fstab # print out all lines in /etc/fstab file
  ```
  
  We can reference every column (as delimited by whitespace) by variables associated with their column number. The first column can be referenced by `$1` for instance. The entire line can by referenced by `$0`


### difference betweet `` `stuff` `` and `$(stuff)`

```bash
echo `whoami`

echo $(whoami)
```

The old-style backquotes `` ` ` `` do treat backslashes and nesting a bit different.

The new-style `$()` interprets everything in between ( ) as a command.

```bash
echo $(uname | $(echo cat))
Linux

echo `uname | `echo cat``
bash: command substitution: line 2: syntax error: unexpected end of file
echo cat
```

works if the nested backquotes are escaped:

```bash
echo `uname | \`echo cat\``
Linux
```

backslash fun:

```bash
echo $(echo '\\')
\\

echo `echo '\\'`
\
```

The new-style `$()` applies to all POSIX-conformant shells.
As mouviciel pointed out, old-style `` ` ` `` might be necessary for older shells.

Apart from the technical point of view, the old-style `` ` ` `` has also a visual disadvantage:

Hard to notice: I like `$(program)` better than `` `program` ``

Easily confused with a single quote: `` '`'`''`''`'`''`' ``

Not so easy to type (maybe not even on the standard layout of the keyboard)

## ShortCut

### Searching Through The Command History

  ```bash
  # To search backward in the history for a particular string, type C-r. Typing C-s searches forward through the histor
  # ie. C-r goes in direction of from the newest histroy to the oldest
  # ie. C-s goes in direction of from the oldest to the newest

  # example:
  (reverse-i-search)`ss': ssh -vvv lp123
  ```

###  .bash_profile, .profile, .bashrc, zshrc, .zlogin

[Good resource](https://superuser.com/questions/183870/difference-between-bashrc-and-bash-profile)

Traditionally, when you log into a Unix system, the system would start one program for you. That program is a shell, i.e., a program designed to start other programs. It's a command line shell: you start another program by typing its name. The default shell, a Bourne shell, reads commands from `~/.profile` when it is invoked as the login shell.

Bash is a Bourne-like shell. It reads commands from `~/.bash_profile` when it is invoked as the login shell, and if that file doesn't existÂ¹, it tries reading `~/.profile` instead.

You can invoke a shell directly at any time, for example by launching a terminal emulator inside a GUI environment. If the shell is not a login shell, it doesn't read `~/.profile`. When you start bash as an interactive shell (i.e., not to run a script), it reads `~/.bashrc` (except when invoked as a login shell, then it only reads `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile`.

Therefore:

`~/.profile` is the place to put stuff that applies to your whole session, such as programs that you want to start when you log in (but not graphical programs, they go into a different file), and environment variable definitions.

`~/.bashrc` is the place to put stuff that applies only to bash itself, such as alias and function definitions, shell options, and prompt settings. (You could also put key bindings there, but for bash they normally go into `~/.inputrc`.)

`~/.bash_profile` can be used instead of `~/.profile`, but it is read by bash only, not by any other shell. (This is mostly a concern if you want your initialization files to work on multiple machines and your login shell isn't bash on all of them.) This is a logical place to include `~/.bashrc` if the shell is interactive. I recommend the following contents in `~/.bash_profile`:

```
if [ -r ~/.profile ]; then . ~/.profile; fi
case "$-" in *i*) if [ -r ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc; fi;; esac
```

On modern unices, there's an added complication related to `~/.profile`. If you log in in a graphical environment (that is, if the program where you type your password is running in graphics mode), you don't automatically get a login shell that reads `~/.profile`. Depending on the graphical login program, on the window manager or desktop environment you run afterwards, and on how your distribution configured these programs, your `~/.profile` may or may not be read. If it's not, there's usually another place where you can define environment variables and programs to launch when you log in, but there is unfortunately no standard location.

Note that you may see here and there recommendations to either put environment variable definitions in `~/.bashrc` or always launch login shells in terminals. Both are bad ideas. The most common problem with either of these ideas is that your environment variables will only be set in programs launched via the terminal, not in programs started directly with an icon or menu or keyboard shortcut.

Â¹ For completeness, by request: if `.bash_profile` doesn't exist, bash also tries `.bash_login` before falling back to `.profile`. Feel free to forget it exists.


### stdout, stdin, stderr

It is good practice to redirect all error messages to `stderr`, while directing regular output to stdout. It is beneficial to do this because anything written to `stderr` is not buffered, i.e., it is immediately written to the screen so that the user can be warned immediately.

Python example:

```python
HOST="www.example.org"
# Ports are handled in ~/.ssh/config since we use OpenSSH
COMMAND="uname -a"

ssh = subprocess.Popen(["ssh", "%s" % HOST, COMMAND],
                       shell=False,
                       stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                       stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
result = ssh.stdout.readlines()
if result == []:
    error = ssh.stderr.readlines()
    print >>sys.stderr, "ERROR: %s" % error  # Note: the '>>' will redirect error to stderr
else:
    print result
```

### `&>` and `>&` and `>`

`STDIN` is represented by `0`, `STDOUT` by `1`, and STDERR by `2.

```
There  are  two  formats  for  redirecting standard output and standard
   error:

          &>word
   and
          >&word

   Of the two forms, the first is preferred.  This is semantically equiva-
   lent to

          >word 2>&1
```

That is , 
- `command 1> file` redirects the stdout to a file, stderr will show 
- `command 2> file` redirects the stderr to a file, stdout will show
- `command &> file` is redirects both stdout and stderr to file, neither stderr or stdout will show, that is same as `command > file 2>&1`


# Terminal shortcut

[Shortcuts to move faster in Bash command line](http://teohm.com/blog/shortcuts-to-move-faster-in-bash-command-line/)

[bash shortcuts](http://www.skorks.com/2009/09/bash-shortcuts-for-maximum-productivity/)

### Basic moves

- Move back one character. `Ctrl + b`
- Move forward one character. `Ctrl + f`
- Delete current character. `Ctrl + d`
- Delete previous character. `Backspace`
- Undo. `Ctrl + -`

### Moving faster and

- Move to the start of line. `Ctrl + a`
- Move to the end of line. `Ctrl + e`
- Move forward a word. `Meta + f` (a word contains alphabets and digits, no symbols)
- Move backward a word. `Meta + b`
- Move between start of command line and current cursor position (and back again). `Ctrl + xx`
- Clear the screen. `Ctrl + l`

**What is Meta?** **Meta** is your Alt key, normally. For Mac OSX user, you need to enable it yourself. Open Terminal > Preferences > Settings > Keyboard, and enable Use option as meta key. Meta key, by convention, is used for operations on word. **By default, you can use `ESC` instead of Meta(alt) key.**

### Cut, paste (â€˜Kill and yankâ€™ for old schoolers) and editing words

- Cut from cursor to the end of line. `Ctrl + k`
- Cut from cursor to the end of word. `Meta + d`
- Cut from cursor to the start of word. `Meta + Backspace`
- Cut from cursor to previous whitespace. `Ctrl + w`
- Cut from cursor to the begining of the line. `Ctrl + u`
- Paste the last cut text. `Ctrl + y`
- Loop through and paste previously cut text. `Meta + y` (use it after `Ctrl + y`)
- Loop through and paste the last argument of previous commands. `Meta + .`
- Capitalize first character. `Meta + c`
- Capitalize the whole word. `Meta + u`
- Swap current word with previous. `Meta + t`

### Search the command history

- Search as you type. `Ctrl + r` and type the search term; Repeat `Ctrl + r` to loop through results.
- Search the last remembered search term. `Ctrl + r` twice.
- End the search at current history entry. `Ctrl + j`
- Cancel the search and restore original line. `Ctrl + g` or `ESC`

### Others

- stops the output to the screen (for long running verbose command). `Ctrl + s` 
- allow output to the screen (if previously stopped using command above). `Ctrl + q` 
- terminate the command. `Ctrl + c` 
- suspend/stop the command. `Ctrl + z` 

### Bash Bang (!) Commands

Bash also has some handy features that use the ! (bang) to allow you to do some funky stuff with bash commands.

- `!!` â€“ run last command
- `!blah` â€“ run the most recent command that starts with â€˜blahâ€™ (e.g. !ls)
- `!blah:p` â€“ print out the command that !blah would run (also adds it as the latest command in the command history)
- `!$` â€“ the last word of the previous command (same as Alt + .)
- `!$:p` â€“ print out the word that !$ would substitute
- `!*` â€“ the previous command except for the last word (e.g. if you type â€˜find some_file.txt /â€˜, then !* would give you â€˜find some_file.txtâ€˜)
- `!*:p` â€“ print out what !* would substitute
